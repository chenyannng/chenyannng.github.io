<br>This website is designed to share my personal projects, mainly for data science.
<br>
<br>I studied psychology for my college and Master's degree and worked as a neuroscience researcher for a few years before leaving academia. My research projects investigated the neural basis for complex animal behavior like social hierarchy, decision making, etc. I also had experience working at tech companies in the field of data analysis, project management and marketing.
